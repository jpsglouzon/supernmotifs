### Super n-motifs model ###

**Comparison of RNA secondary structures** of arbitrary size uncovers **structural patterns** that can provide a better understanding of **RNA functions**. However, performing fast, accurate **secondary structure comparisons** is **challenging** when we take into account **the nature of the RNA** (i.e., linear or circular), the presence of **pseudoknot** and **G-quadruplex** (G4) motifs and the **increasing number of secondary structures** generated by high-throughput probing techniques. To address this challenge, we propose the **super-n-motifs model**, based on the super-n-motifs representation which considers secondary structures as combinations of motifs with their local context, i.e., adjacent motifs.
  
The super n-motifs model computes dissimilarities between RNA secondary structures (SS) based on super n-motifs representation. It takes as input SSs in vienna/db format. It provides various ouputs, in csv format, (see -p parameter) such as the dissimilarity matrix i.e. the SS\*SS dissimilarity matrix (matDissim_SSbySS.csv) and others such as the matrix representing the super n-motifs representation of SS i.e. the SS\*super n-motifs matrix (matSnmRep_SSbySnm.csv), etc.

### How to run the super n-motifs program ###

Usage:

* supernmotifs [Parameters]...	

Examples : 

* Execute super n-motifs in command line

  ./pathOfSupernmotifsProgram/supernmotifs -i /PathtoDbFile
  -o /OutputDirectoryPath/ -s 15
  
* Switch the graphical user interface

  ./pathOfSupernmotifsprogram/super_n-motifs -w 1
  

Important note:

* Circular RNA 

  For the processing of secondary structures of circular RNA, adding 'c_'
   at the beginning of the header of each circular RNA is required. 		
   
* Pseudoknots and Gquadruplexes

  Special characters '{}','<>','[]', and alphabets such as 'Aa','Bb','Zz' are used to represent base pairs involved in pseudoknots. '+' is used to represent each guanine involved in the Gquadraplexes formation.

### Parameters ###


  -h 	
		 	
	Print help and exit the program.
	
  -w 	
		 	
	Switch to the graphical user interface (GUI). Type -w 1 to activate the GUI. (default: -w 0)
	
  -i [input vienna file]  
  
    Input file of RSS in vienna/db format (required).
    >strucID
    AAAAAUU
    ((...))

  -o [output folder] 	
  
    Results folder (required).

  -l [0|1|2] 
  
    Specify the maximum level of n-motifs used to 
    extract the n-motifs. It must be 0, 1 or 2. For instance: when 
    it is set to 0, 0-motifs will be extracted. When it is set 
    to 1, 0-motifs and 1-motifs will be extracted. etc.
    (default : -l 1)

  -s [s>=2]
	
    Specify  the number of super n-motifs. 
    (default : -s 15)

  -m [m>=0]	
	
    Specify the minimum occurrence of n-motifs. N-motifs with occurrence
    below the minimum occurrence are removed. When it is set to 0, 
    it computes the automatic n-motif minimum occurrence. 
    (default : -m 0)

  -p [0|1|2|3|4]	
    
     Specify the output options. 
     (default: -p 0)
     '-p 0' to output the SS*SS dissimilarity matrix (matDissim_SSbySS.csv) 
     '-p 1' to output the SS*super n-motifs matrix that is the super n-motif
     representation of SS (matSnmRep_SSbySnm.csv),
     '-p 2' to output the SS*SS dissimilarity matrix (matDissim_SSbySS.csv),
     the SS*n-motifs dissimilarity matrix (matDissim_SSbynm.csv), the 
     SS*supern-motifs matrix that is the super n-motif representation of SS
     (matSnmRep_SSbySnm.csv), the n-motifs*super n-motifs matrix that is the 	
     super n-motifs representation of n-motifs (matSnmRep_nmbySnm.csv),
     '-p 3' to output the SS*SS dissimilarity matrix based on the n-motif 
     representation (matDissimNmotifsBased_SSbySS.csv),
     '-p 4' to output the SS*n-motifs matrix that is the n-motif representation 
     of SS (matNmRep_SSbyNm.csv), or 5 to get all outputs with their full 
     version including the singular values associated with the super n-motifs 
     (singularValues_supernmotifs.csv)
     '-p 5' to get all outputs with their full version including 
     the singular values associated with the super n-motifs 
     (singularValues_supernmotifs.csv) and  some statistics 
     (raw nb. n-motifs, nb. n-motifs etc.) (stat.csv).
