# The super-n-motifs model #

**Comparing RNA secondary structures** of arbitrary size uncovers **structural patterns** that can provide a better understanding of **RNA functions**. However, performing fast and accurate **secondary structure comparisons** is **challenging** when we take into account the **RNA configuration (i.e., linear or circular)**, the presence of **pseudoknot** and **G-quadruplex (G4)** motifs and the **increasing number of secondary structures** generated by high-throughput probing techniques. To address this challenge, we propose the **super-n-motifs model**, based on a latent analysis of enhanced motifs comprising not only basic motifs but also adjacency relations. The super-n-motifs model computes a vector representation of secondary structures as linear combinations of these motifs.

Download **[here](https://github.com/jpsglouzon/supernmotifs/releases)** the executable (ubuntu 64) or source code of the super-n-motifs model.

## Compilation ##

The compilation of the super-n-motifs model requires the installation of the boost library (http://www.boost.org/). 

Optimization flag (-O1, -O2 or -o3) must be turn on.

## Usage ##

The program takes as input a file of **rna secondary structures** in **dot-bracket** format:
```
>RNA1
GCCCCGCUGAUGAGGUCAGGGAAAACCGAAAGUGUCGACUCUACGGGGC
((((((.......((((......))))...((((....)))).))))))
```
The super-n-motifs model supports circular RNA, pseudoknots and g-quadruplexes. **Circular RNA** require to add `c_` at the beginning of the header of each RNA :  `>c_RNA1`. Base pairs involved in **pseudoknots** are typically represented by special characters `{}`, `<>`, `[]`, and alphabets such as `Aa` or `Bb` : `..AA..aa`. Interacting guanines in **g-quadruplexes** are represented by `+` : `..((..++.++.++..++.)).`.

Compare the secondary structures by calling: 
```
supernmotifs -i fileInDb -o folderOfResults
```
