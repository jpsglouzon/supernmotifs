  "body": "# The super-n-motifs model #\r\n\r\n**Comparing RNA secondary structures** of arbitrary size uncovers **structural patterns** that can provide a better understanding of **RNA functions**. However, performing fast and accurate **secondary structure comparisons** is **challenging** when we take into account the **RNA configuration (i.e., linear or circular)**, the presence of **pseudoknot** and **G-quadruplex (G4)** motifs and the **increasing number of secondary structures** generated by high-throughput probing techniques. To address this challenge, we propose the **super-n-motifs model**, based on a latent analysis of enhanced motifs comprising not only basic motifs but also adjacency relations. The super-n-motifs model computes a vector representation of secondary structures as linear combinations of these motifs.\r\n\r\nDownload **[here](https://github.com/jpsglouzon/supernmotifs/releases)** the executable (ubuntu 64) or source code of the super-n-motifs model.\r\n\r\n## Compilation ##\r\n\r\nThe compilation of the super-n-motifs model requires the installation of the boost library (http://www.boost.org/). \r\n\r\nOptimization flag (-O3) must be turn on.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nThe program takes as input a file of **rna secondary structures** in **dot-bracket** format:\r\n```\r\n>RNA1\r\nGCCCCGCUGAUGAGGUCAGGGAAAACCGAAAGUGUCGACUCUACGGGGC\r\n((((((.......((((......))))...((((....)))).))))))\r\n```\r\nThe super-n-motifs model supports circular RNA, pseudoknots and g-quadruplexes. **Circular RNA** require to add `c_` at the beginning of the header of each RNA :  `>c_RNA1`. Base pairs involved in **pseudoknots** are typically represented by special characters `{}`, `<>`, `[]`, and alphabets such as `Aa` or `Bb` : `..AA..aa`. Interacting guanines in **g-quadruplexes** are represented by `+` : `..((..++.++.++..++.)).`.\r\n\r\nCompare the secondary structures by calling: \r\n```\r\nsupernmotifs -i fileInDb -o folderOfResults\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
