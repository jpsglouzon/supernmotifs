  "body": "### Super-n-motifs model ###\r\n\r\n**Comparing RNA secondary structures** of arbitrary size uncovers **structural patterns** that can provide a better understanding of **RNA functions**. However, performing fast and accurate **secondary structure comparisons** is **challenging** when we take into account the **RNA configuration (i.e., linear or circular)**, the presence of **pseudoknot** and **G-quadruplex (G4)** motifs and the **increasing number of secondary structures** generated by high-throughput probing techniques. To address this challenge, we propose the **super-n-motifs model**, based on a latent analysis of enhanced motifs comprising not only basic motifs but also adjacency relations. The super-n-motifs model computes a vector representation of secondary structures as linear combinations of these motifs.\r\n  \r\nThe super-n-motifs model computes dissimilarities between RNA secondary structures (SS) based on super-n-motifs representation. It takes as input SS in vienna/db format. It provides various ouputs, in csv format, (see -p parameter) such as the dissimilarity matrix i.e. the SS\\*SS dissimilarity matrix (matDissim_SSbySS.csv) and others such as the matrix representing the super-n-motifs representation of SS i.e. the SS\\*super n-motifs matrix (matSnmRep_SSbySnm.csv), etc.\r\n\r\n### How to run the super-n-motifs program ###\r\nThe compilation of the super-n-motifs model requires the installation of the boost library (http://www.boost.org/).\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n* supernmotifs [Parameters]...\t\r\n\r\nExamples : \r\n\r\n* Execute super-n-motifs in command line\r\n\r\n  ./pathOfSupernmotifsProgram/supernmotifs -i /PathtoDbFile\r\n  -o /OutputDirectoryPath/\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n\r\n* Circular RNA \r\n\r\n  For the processing of secondary structures of circular RNA, adding 'c_'\r\n   at the beginning of the header of each circular RNA is required. \t\t\r\n   \r\n* Pseudoknots and Gquadruplexes\r\n\r\n  Special characters '{}','<>','[]', and alphabets such as 'Aa','Bb','Zz' \r\n  are used to represent base pairs involved in pseudoknots. '+' is used to \r\n  represent each guanine involved in the Gquadraplexes formation.\r\n\r\n### Parameters ###\r\n\r\n  -h \t\r\n\t\t \t\r\n\tPrint help and exit the program.\r\n\t\r\n  -i [input vienna file]  \r\n  \r\n    Input file of RSS in vienna/db format (required).\r\n    >strucID\r\n    AAAAAUU\r\n    ((...))\r\n\r\n  -o [output folder] \t\r\n  \r\n    Results folder (required).\r\n\r\n  -n [0|1|2] \r\n  \r\n    Specify the maximum level of n-motifs used to \r\n    extract the n-motifs.
